<section id="outline"><h2>Outline</h2>
<p>The goal of this best practice is to improve the quality of government data by enabling feedback channels for users to report errors, inconsistencies, incompleteness in already published data.</p>
</section>


<section id="ms"><h2>Management Summary</h2>
<section id="challenge"><h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>Often re-users of governmental datasets make copies in order to curate their local copy of the data (for example, fixing errors or completing data). This approach is not optimal as it leads to duplication of efforts and reduces the possibility of sharing and re-use.</p>
</section>

<section id="solution"><h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Responsible public sector bodies should provide feedback mechanisms through which stakeholders can identify mistakes and correct them where possible. One possible practical approach could be to use a distributed versioning system for the published data, such as GitHub, in order to improve open data as is common for open source software. Alternatively, provide a simple feedback loop using comment boxes, forums etc. Public sector bodies should actively encourage stakeholders/re-users to use these mechanisms.</p>

<section id="bpi"><h2>Best Practice Identification</h2>
<section id="why"><h3>Why is this a Best Practice? What’s the impact of the Best Practice</h3>
<p>Anyone using data, whether they're part of the organisation that creates it or an external re-user, will want the data to be accurate. This is difficult to achieve, requiring time end effort - i.e. it can be expensive. By creating mechanisms through which datasets can be corrected by the community of users, the cost is distributed. Although the data itself may not be crowd-sourced, its curation can be, to the benefit of everyone, including hte publisher.</p>

<section id="whyNeed"><h3>Why is there a need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<p>The European Commission notice <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2014.240.01.0001.01.ENG#d1e433-1-1" title="Guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the reuse of documents">2014/C 240/01 paragraph 3.2</a> states: "To facilitate the use of data in the public sector while significantly increasing the value of datasets for subsequent re-use, it is recommended that datasets be: [...] subject to regular feedback from re-users (public consultations, comments box, blogs, automated reporting, etc.) to maintain quality over time and promote public involvement."
</section>

<section id="whatNeed"><h3>What do you need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<p>Tools for collecting feedback. Innovative ways such as crowdsourcing can be used for collecting and improving the quality of existing government data sources. Issue tracking and bug reporting platforms are commonplace in open source software projects and such tools can readily be used for collecting feedback about datasets.</p>
